					<h4>Long Description</h4>
					<p class="left-align light">Nestled in an upper-middle class suburban community in the northern tip of Delaware is an English speaking congregation within a church founded by Chinese immigrants. Over the decades, slow but steady progress grew this congregation into not just middle and high schoolers but also a college group and a band of adult believers and seekers. Even though this is an English speaking congregation, all age groups in the English ministry encompass first, second, and third generation Chinese immigrants as well as some non-Asian Americans. Cross-cultural couples also make up an important ministry focus.</p>

					<p class="left-align light">For children, the church runs a vibrant worship, choir, and Sunday school program and hosts an AWANA club on Friday nights.</p>

					<h4>History</h4>
					<p class="left-align light">Beginning in the 1960's, a handful of local Christian professionals and students in Delaware and southeastern Pennsylvania held monthly fellowships and Bible study meetings. On January 4, 1981, the Wilmington Chinese Evangelical Church was formally founded. Rev. Edward Knettler helped with the pastoral duties. In November 1982, Rev. David Mao came from Taiwan to serve as the Senior Pastor. The vision of the church was “Missions and Church Planting”.</p>
					<p class="left-align light">Between 1981 and 1983, the church held its Sunday worship services in the afternoon at Bethany Baptist Church in Newport, DE. In the fall of 1983, the church moved to the Chinese American Community Center (CACC) in Hockessin, DE and started Sunday morning worship services. In January 1988, the Co-Workers' Committee was formerly renamed the Board of Deacons. Brother Chia-Lin Wang and Hsiang Shih were elected Elders in January 1991. Brother Tah-Ben Hsu was elected Elder in January 1993. On January 1, 2001, the church officially changed its name to Wilmington Community Evangelical Church.</p>
					<p class="left-align light">In 1987, the church members purchased more than 10 acres of land near the intersection of Route 7 and Brackenville Road as the first step toward fulfilling a church building vision. In March, 1992, the church held the groundbreaking service for new church building. After over a year of working with united hearts and spirit, the church held its Building Dedication Ceremony on June 13, 1993.</p>
